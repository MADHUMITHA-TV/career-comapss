Build a complete full-stack web application called Career Compass - Job & Career Assistant using React.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and MySQL for the database. The application should help college students analyze job descriptions and evaluate their job readiness. Implement the following features:

Frontend (React.js):

A responsive homepage where students can:

Paste a job description.

Upload or paste their resume.

Display an intelligent match score (e.g., "Strong Match - 8/10") with visual representation (progress bar or star rating).

Show a gap analysis, e.g., "This role requires 'Docker' and 'AWS' but your resume doesn't mention these."

Offer one actionable tip to improve their application.

Support a chat-style input for natural language queries like:

"What skills should I learn for data science roles?"

"Am I ready for frontend developer positions?"

Create pages/components for: Dashboard, Job Analysis, Gap Analysis, Recommendations, and a Q&A chat section.

Backend (Node.js / Express):

Implement REST APIs to handle:

Resume upload and parsing.

Job description analysis.

Skill matching and scoring.

Gap analysis computation.

Saving user history and queries to MySQL.

Integrate a simple AI/ML-based matching engine (can use pre-trained models or a keyword-based scoring algorithm).

Implement endpoints for:

/api/analyze-job (POST: job description + resume → returns match score, gap analysis, tips)

/api/query (POST: natural language query → returns response)

/api/history (GET/POST: user job analyses)

Database (MySQL):

Create tables for:

Users (id, name, email, password)

Job_Analyses (id, user_id, job_description, resume_text, match_score, gap_analysis, recommendation, created_at)

Skills (id, name)

Store user queries and their results for future reference.

Other Requirements:

Use React Router for navigation.

Use Axios for API calls from frontend to backend.

Include basic authentication (login/register).

Provide a clean, modern UI (preferably using Material-UI or TailwindCSS).

Comment the code for clarity.

Make the project ready to deploy on Replit or similar platforms.

Please generate the complete folder structure with all frontend and backend files, including package.json, React components, Node.js server, and MySQL table creation scripts.
